Solve with this if asked to solve with a time complexity of "O(logn)".


OVERFLOW CASE: 

int mid = (low + high) / 2;
IF:  low = 1,500,000,000  
     high = 1,600,000,000
low + high = 3,100,000,000 exceeds: INT_MAX (2,147,483,647)   :   Integer overflow

Solution: Use int mid=  low+ [(high-low)/2]

IF huge numbers use long long...
