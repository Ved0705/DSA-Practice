We are kind of deriving it from the 2 Sum approach...
Since original index are not asked so no need of hashmap shit and also we can sort the given array..... **2 POINTER**
Now Run a loop over the sorted arrray upto n-2... because its abt 3 elements(n-3 n-2 n-1 )
Now target= -nums[i].... and currsum(nums[l]+nums[r]) should be equal to target...
