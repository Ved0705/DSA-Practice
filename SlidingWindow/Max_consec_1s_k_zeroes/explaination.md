So we can have max **k zeroes**....

-we run  a loop now if check if any elemenrtris zero if yes then zeroes++.
-now we run a loop until the number of zeroes are greater than k where we shrink the subarray from the leftside and reduce the count of zero after every occurence of it.
[ while(zeroes>k) ]
